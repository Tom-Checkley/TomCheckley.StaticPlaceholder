        <p>Hi, I'm Tom and I'm living the dream, I get paid for my hobby! I have around 9 years development experience. I currently work on builds and maintenance for a braod range of clients at <a class="link" href="https://www.element78.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Element 78</a> based in Bristol.</p>
        <p>I started coding professionally in 2017 at Element 78 as a Frontend Developer, developing the skills I'd been teaching myself whilst coding as a hobby. I love taking the Design and UX Team's ideas to create solutions that makes our clients shine. </p>
        <p>Whilst on the Frontend Team, I became more and more involved in the Javascript side of FE development. Working with Angular (js and 2+), Vue and vanilla Javascript I have grown a real passion for the more programatic side of coding.</p>
        <p>Due to this, when a position in the Backend Team opened up in 2021 I switched teams. Chucking myself straight back to the beginning and a whole new learning curve. As part of the Backend Team I have been developing my skills in C#, .Net and creating great content editor expeiences with Umbraco CMS.</p>
